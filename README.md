# Movie Recommender System
In this project, we aim to develop a movie recommender system that can suggest movies based on the input movie provided by the user. The system uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to extract relevant keywords and generate a list of tags for each movie. The cosine similarity algorithm is then used to calculate the similarity scores between each movie, based on their tags, to generate a list of recommended movies. 
 
The project's goal is to provide a reliable and user-friendly movie recommendation system that can assist users in discovering new and exciting movies based on their preferences. The system's accuracy and performance will be evaluated based on the quality and relevance of the recommendations provided to the users. 
 
Overall, the project has the potential to improve the user experience of movie viewers by making the process of discovering new movies more accessible and enjoyable. The project's methodology and results can be used as a starting point for developing more advanced and sophisticated recommendation systems in the future.
